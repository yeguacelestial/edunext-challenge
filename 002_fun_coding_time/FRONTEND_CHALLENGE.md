eduNEXT Coding Challenge
========================

This is the challenge for the front end developer position. You only need to answer it if you want to apply for a job in front end development.


Situation description
=====================

As we saw on the challenge stack section, for each of our customers, we keep a configuration object stored in the database. This configuration object is something we can interact with using a REST API that exposes the JSON for all our internal services and applications.

An example of the object we store and access for each customer is:

```
{
    "SUBSCRIPTION": "basic",
    "CREATION_DATE": "2013-03-10T02:00:00Z",
    "LAST_PAYMENT_DATE": "2010-01-10T09:25:00Z",
    "theme_name": "Tropical Island",
    "ENABLED_FEATURES": {
        "CERTIFICATES_INSTRUCTOR_GENERATION": true,
        "INSTRUCTOR_BACKGROUND_TASKS": true
        "ENABLE_COURSEWARE_SEARCH": true,
        "ENABLE_COURSE_DISCOVERY": true,
        "ENABLE_DASHBOARD_SEARCH": true,
        "ENABLE_EDXNOTES": true,
    },
    "language_code": "en",
    "banner_message": "<p><span>Welcome</span> to Mr X's website</p>"
    "displayed_timezone": "America/Bogota"
    "user_profile_image": "https://i.imgur.com/LMhM8nn.jpg"
    "user_email": "barack@aol.com",
}
```


Challenge
=========

The challenge for you is to create a nice front end application where a particular customer can interact with his or her own data. This application should have good usability patterns, be nice to eye and also prevent the user from damaging the information we keep stored.

For the technology, you can use any modern framework that you want. We use backbone for some applications (old school, I know), and we like react, so it will be nice to see some of that, but you can choose anything you want as long as it's a modern framework. Please don't just use a placeholder with hundreds of files if you don't need them.

Look at each field, its name and value and you will see we have different data types. Some may require a different type of input field, a selector or a complex widget to be correctly modified. Some fields are read only and some are even private fields.

You can imagine this application will eventually be the settings page for the user account page. Make your users love it.

Now let's talk about each of the fields.

SUBSCRIPTION
------------
The tier of service the user is in. It might be one of: "free", "basic", "premium". Stored as a string. The user should not be able to modify it, but he needs to see it.

CREATION_DATE
-------------
A datetime in iso format. Stored as a string, the user might see it, but the format is not very user friendly. The user must not be able to modify it.

LAST_PAYMENT_DATE
-----------------
A datetime in iso format. Stored as a string, the user needs to see it, but the format is not very user friendly. The user must not be able to modify it.

theme_name
----------
This is one of the variables the user needs to choose. He or she can pick it from a list:

"Simply Fabulous",
"Tropical Island",
"Safari",
"Tranquility",
"Mustache Bash",
"Candy Crush",
"Garden Party"


ENABLED_FEATURES
----------------
This is a nested field, the user must be able to select which feature he wants to turn on or off. The ability to change a specific feature also depends on the SUBSCRIPTION level. Users in the free tier can only turn on one of the features. Users in the Basic tier can choose to change up to 3 features, and Users in the premium tier can choose to change any of them.


language_code
-------------
The ISO_639 language for the user. Stored as a string. The user can choose from:

Chinese | zh
Italian | it
English | en
Spanish | es
French  | fr
German  | de

Only the 2 letter code is stored.

banner_message
--------------

A string storing an html field where the user display a welcome message. It needs to be escaped.


displayed_timezone
------------------
A string representing any valid time zone in the America/Bogota format. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

user_profile_image
------------------
A string field containing the user's profile image URL. The user must see the photo, but to keep this challenge simple, there is no need for him to change it.

user_email
----------
A string representing the users email. The user can change it, but it would be safer to validate that the input is a real email.
