# eduNEXT Coding Challenge

In this repository you will find the description and files of three coding challenges.

## For Devs: Back end

The developer challenge is designed to give us an overview on your dexterity when developing web applications based on python as the underlying backend language with the usage of django or flask as the application framework of choice.

## For Devs: Front end

The developer challenge is designed to give us an overview on your dexterity when creating rich applications that run in the browser and interact with a server side api using modern front end technologies for both functionality and style.

## For DevOps

The devops challenge is geared towards testing your ability to manage infrastructure and deployment of web applications in an automated way that allows us to obtain the high reliability that we offer to our customers and also to iterate fast in our development.

# Assessment

The main objective of this challenge is not only to determine whether you have the technical knowledge, but also to try and find what motivates you and how you find creative and elegant solutions to meet the requirements.

We are looking for someone who is a good fit for our team, and this requires that candidates alongside their code and technical skill are also motivated to work and to lead projects and features into completion, and that they are capable of communicating effectively with other members of the team and customers about the requirements, the specifications or the status of the work.

We will look at the results of this challenge through the lens of:

- Communication
    + Clear and complete
- Independence of work
- Tech skills & best practices
    + Correctness of the solution
    + Architecture of the solution
    + QA
        * Code quality
        * Unit testing


# Delivering

To share this code effectively with us and keep your work secure, we suggest that you create a free account on BitBucket or github and push the code to your own repo. Upon completion of the challenge, please share your fork with our accounts:

- https://bitbucket.org/FelipeM_ntoya/
- https://bitbucket.org/juancamilom/

or

- https://github.com/felipemontoya/
- https://github.com/juancamilom/

You can also push it to github, but please don't fork it in a public repo since all the participants of the challenge could then access your solution.

Then clone/push this repository into your own account and use it as the location to store the code.

Work freely and commit to the repository as you go.
Push to your remote repository. If this is not an option, you can zip the complete directory and send it to us by email at the end.

In case of any question, feel free to communicate with us using the Basecamp project we will invite you to as a part of this challenge.
