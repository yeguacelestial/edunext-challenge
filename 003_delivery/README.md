eduNEXT Coding Challenge
========================

How to deliver your work.

Please keep in mind that while your code will be run by computers, it will be read by a team of people. Code that does what is meant to do, but it is impossible to decipher by anyone other than you is of no use.


Git
---
Commit your code in this repository using a branch. We maintain order of the repository by using the [gihub-flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

Divide your changes into commits in a way that highlights the context of your changes. Make the commit messages clear, as this is what we will use to understand the decisions you made along the way. You can find a useful guide to make better commit messages here: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/.

Commit only the relevant files. Compiled files are not necessary and only make your code more difficult to review. This includes python pyc files and artifacts from the build process and virtualenvs. It also includes artifacts of the front end build process. If your css or js is compiled on the flight, then write down the command you need to build it in a place we can see, and you can safely ignore the files in the repository.


Comments
--------
Use comments in your code when you need to explain the intent of you code.

Format and linting
------------------
There are many code formatters and linters for every language. Use them. Make your code conform to a sensible set of rules of pylint, pep8, eslint, sass-lint or any other that you need. Once you get used to it, there is no coming back.


Communicate with us
-------------------
Along with this challenge, you have been invited to a Basecamp Project. You can reach out to us if something is not clear, or you are having specific problems that need additional input or data.
